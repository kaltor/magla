                    Marwan Pablo first started making music in 2015, being known with the
                    moniker "Dama" at the time. At one point, he decided to disappear and
                    rediscover himself, only to came back in late 2017 with the single 'Al
                    Gholaf X Ozoris' under the name of "Marwan Pablo" in reference to both
                    Pablo Escobar and Pablo Picasso as he mentions in his single 'Free'.
                    Pablo began his career writing his own lyrics and eventually evolved
                    into producing the tracks as well. <br />
                    Cairo has long been the city for up and coming musicians, but Marwan
                    Pablo was trying to change that by popularizing trap music in his
                    hometown of Alexandria.[7][8] For that end, Pablo shot to fame in
                    2018, starring in the "Rabka" documentary and releasing his first hits
                    'SINdBAD', 'Abu Meca' and 'Folklor' in collaboration with the rising
                    Egyptian producer "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChx2KJtQ332gWHZDYSC0oVg" target="_blank" >Molotof
                </a>",and now on his utube channel he has about 29,754,292 üëÅviews .</i

            <p>
              On February 14 of 2020, Pablo announced that, for personal and religious
              reasons, he will no longer be making music.[9][10] Shortly after, he
              blanked both his YouTube channel and Instagram account.[11] The artist
              explained that the main reason he retired is "the pressure that was forced
              on him, the different levels of expectations that people have cornered him
              within, and the constant labeling". He said that he needed a break to
              "recharge himself without being cornered".[12] On March 9, 2020, Pablo
              went live on Instagram in response to rumors of his illness or death. He
              expressed fury over the anecdotes and denied any relation between the
              retirement and his health or family members.[13] Despite the retirement,
              his Denamet (with Molotof) was the runner-up in Egypt's top 5 list as of
              July 2020.

            <p>
              On January 2021, Pablo's name was trending again when news circulated of
              his prospective return after his profile picture on Facebook was changed.
              The new picture gained a hundred thousand likes in a couple of hours, but
              he never made an official announcement about it. <br />
              On February 19th, a leaked video on Twitter showcasing Pablo working on a
              new song, preparing for his return, went viral. His name topped the
              trending list on Twitter that day in Egypt.[18][19] On February 25th,
              Pablo returned to the music industry with the release of 'Ghaba' [Jungle]
              and reactivating all his social media accounts. Marwan Pablo's comeback
              music video surpassed 4,000,000 views on YouTube within the first 24 hours
              after release and hit the platform's top 10 trending worldwide. <br />
              On March 29th he announced an album named 'CTRL' containing 5 singles
              'Ghaba', 'El Hob Fein', 'CTRL', 'DON' and 'Atary' which was a previously
              released unfinished song before Pablo's retirement.
